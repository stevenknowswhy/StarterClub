 To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#root-directory for more information.

You're importing a component that needs `usePathname`. This React Hook only works in a Client Component. To fix, mark the file (or its parent) with the `"use client"` directive.
